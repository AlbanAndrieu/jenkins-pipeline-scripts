<strong>gitCheckoutBMRepo(vars: null, relativeTargetDir: "TODO") { ... }</strong>

<p>
Do a specific checkout for BM:
(It is needed in case of multi repo in workspace, because one is controlled by jenkins, the other shall not)
<ul>
<li>vars give all the parameters which can be overridden</li>
<li>isDefaultBranch tell if checkout must be controlled by Jenkins</li>
<li>relativeTargetDir is the overridden path where to extract the repo</li>
<li>body Closure is used to add some command behavior once the repo is extracted, such as specific GIT_COMMIT or GIT_REVISION</li>
</ul>
</p>
